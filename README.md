Here have a problem that I couldn't choose to Live when i installed the Debian GNU/Linux Live.
Now I am installing the Debian installer. Evrything on the process. Not so sure can I install this?

I think this casued by i installed the Debian installer but not Debian GNU/Linux live.
-----------Start Over-----------
Step 1: 
- Installed the VirtualBox on Macbook, and created a new Virtual Machine. 
Setp 2:
- Started the app, choosed Debian GNU/Linux Live (kernel 5.10.0-20amd64)
- It didnt work again, so I installed the Debian Installer again on Macbook.
-----------Start Over again------------
Step 1:
Go back to Windows laptop and log in the application.
Step 2:
I typed sudo apt-get update.But there displayed my username is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported. 
Now looking for the root reason of this issue. :(
